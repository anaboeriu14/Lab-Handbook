# Responsible Conduct of Research {.unnumbered}
Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) encompasses ethical practices and standards in scientific research, ensuring integrity, accuracy, and the consideration of societal impacts in both basic and clinical studies. It is a fundamental aspect for researchers at all levels, from students to senior faculty, essential for a thriving research career. 

[UCSF RCR training](https://rcr.ucsf.edu/) provides details on RCR training schedules and access to course materials, external resources, grant proposal templates, and tailored training programs for different types of trainees, ensuring all members understand and engage with the principles of responsible research.

## Authorship in the Lab

Authorship on scientific articles is a significant form of academic recognition and conveys accountability for the content of the work. As a lab, we are committed to upholding the highest standards of integrity and fairness in our authorship practices. These guidelines are designed to ensure that contributions to research are properly acknowledged and that authorship reflects substantial intellectual contributions to the project. Our aim is to foster a collaborative and transparent research environment where credit is given fairly and appropriately.


All authors on a scientific article must meet the [ICMJE Authorship Criteria](https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html): 


- Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; AND
- Drafting the work or reviewing it critically for important intellectual content; AND
- Final approval of the version to be published; AND
- Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.


Authorship contributions should be defined based on the Contributor Roles Taxonomy ([CRediT](https://credit.niso.org/implementing-credit/)). This includes Conceptualizaiton, Methodology, Software, Validation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Resources, Data Curation, Writing - Original Draft, Writing - Review & Editing, Visualization, Supervision, Project administration, and Funding acquisition. Contributions of each author should be documented and agreed upon in writing. This documentation should be revisited and revised as the project progresses and should be included with the manuscript submission if required by the journal.  


The order of authorship should reflect the relative contribution of each author to the research project. The first author is typically the individual who has made the most significant contribution to the work, followed by co-authors in order of decreasing contribution. Disputes over authorship order should be resolved through discussion among all contributors and, if necessary, mediation by the principal investigator (PI).


Individuals who contributed to the research but do not meet the criteria for authorship should be acknowledged in the manuscript.
